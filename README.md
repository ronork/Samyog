## Samyog

Created in the year 2017, Samyog is a portal aimed at creating a dynamic nexus of projects and volunteers working for providing free education to underprivileged children. Many educational and other institutes in India are taking a lead in educating such children with the support of passionate volunteers. Though working for an immensely noble cause, these programs often come across tough challenges such as shortage of volunteers and difficulty in reaching out to the masses. Volunteer too, donâ€™t even have any means to easily locate all these projects let alone getting involved in the cumbersome application process. 
Samyog, with its powerful features aims to counter exactly such challenges, making interaction among the involved parties both simple and meaningful.
